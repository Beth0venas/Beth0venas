- 👋 Hi, I’m @Beth0venas
- 👀 I’m interested in general learning how the codes work - but outside of technologies it would be combat sports, some video games, hiking and of course learning how to invest money
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AWS Certification - Practitioner, Udemy Python developer course, and of course Java on Oracle.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how I could actually learn and expand my knowledge as well as to get a chance to land that first Junior/Graduate Software Developer role.
- 📫 How to reach me rokas.brancevicius@gmail.com
