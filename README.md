- 👋 Hi, I’m @Beth0venas
- 👀 I’m interested in general learning how the codes work - but outside of technologies it would be combat sports, some video games, hiking and of course learning how to invest money
- 🌱 I’m currently on going through a Level 5 DevOps bootcamp - which ought to be finished by end of February 2024. (It involves - DevOps best practices, Networking, Security, Jenkins, AWS, Python, Terraform)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how I could actually learn and expand my knowledge as well as to get a chance to land that first entry level/graduate - Devops/Data engineer role.
- 📫 How to reach me rokas.brancevicius@gmail.com
